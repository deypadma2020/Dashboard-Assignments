Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others. Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data.\n","- A machine is only a device consisting of different parts, and is used for performing different functions.

In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups.\n","- The most significant difference between regression vs classification is that while regression helps predict a continuous quantity, classification predicts discrete class labels. There are also some overlaps between the two types of machine learning algorithms.\n","- The Classification process models a function through which the data is predicted in discrete class labels.
