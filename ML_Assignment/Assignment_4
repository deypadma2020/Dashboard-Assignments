Categorical data is everything else. Categorical data is non-numerical information that is divided into groups. As its name suggests, categorical data describes categories or groups.\n","- While both methods are used for reducing the number of features in a dataset, there is an important difference. Feature selection is simply selecting and excluding given features without changing them. Dimensionality reduction transforms features into a lower dimension."],"metadata":{"id":"CTwx1_1oDc2B"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"R9xfAGRNDnFw"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 4.

A histogram is a display of statistical information that uses rectangles to show the frequency of data items in successive numerical intervals of equal size. In the most common form of histogram, the independent variable is plotted along the horizontal axis and the dependent variable is plotted along the vertical axis.\n","2. Scatter plots are used to plot data points on a horizontal and a vertical axis in the attempt to show how much one variable is affected by another. Each row in the data table is represented by a marker whose position depends on its values in the columns set on the X and Y axes.\n","3.

Bimodal histogram.\n","- Bins are the numerical ranges into which you'll group the data. In presentation histograms your bins should all be the same size and should encompass all of the data. In addition the boundaries should generally occur at nice round numbers.

Each of these measures describes a different indication of the typical or central value in the distribution. \n","  \n","  What is the mode? The mode is the most commonly occurring value in a distribution.\n","- The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set.

Little scatter represents a strong relationship. If all points fall directly on a straight line, we have a perfect linear relationship between our two variables.\n","- If there is a regression line on a scatter plot, you can identify outliers. An outlier for a scatter plot is the point or points that are farthest from the regression line. There is at least one outlier on a scatter plot in most cases, and there is usually only one outlier."],"metadata":{"id":"BtEi5cbXEAft"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"nRVnNwMnEF7p"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 10.
