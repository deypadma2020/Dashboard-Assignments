A text file consists of human readable characters, which can be opened by any text editor. On the other hand, binary files are made up of non-human readable characters and symbols, which require specific programs to access its contents."],"metadata":{"id":"-f0FB0j98Kby"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6S_iu81m7uNu"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q2.

Binary files are used to store data more compactly. In the text file, a special character whose ASCII value is 26 inserted after the last character to mark the end of file. In the binary file no such character is present."],"metadata":{"id":"8rhtLpxY8ohB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"bPUmUBhm8sHl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q3.
