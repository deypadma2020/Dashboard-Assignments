What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?"],"metadata":{"id":"aj4O3E9GHha3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ans: -\n","\n","- A probability distribution describes the probabilities of the values that a random variable can take. It is an important concept in statistics and probability theory, and every book on this topic discusses probability distributions along with their properties.\n","- If you can generalize to the population the results from your sample on specific random variables, then you can predict how those random variables will behave."],"metadata":{"id":"sRe1CSflHhXe"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wWiakd0oHdJb"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q2.

They are not truly random because the computer uses an algorithm based on a distribution, and are not secure because they rely on deterministic, predictable algorithms.\n","- The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages."],"metadata":{"id":"6PuM3MEWH1nz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"w_kxE-A8H5IN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q3.

The mean of the distribution determines the location of the center of the graph, and the standard deviation determines the height and width of the graph."],"metadata":{"id":"vmaaYu-sH9zu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"vrhNMcNYH_p3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q4.
