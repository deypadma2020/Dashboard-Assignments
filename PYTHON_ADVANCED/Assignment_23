Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time.

It makes a sum of money grow at a faster rate than simple interest because you will earn returns on the money you invest, as well as on returns at the end of every compounding period. This means that you don't have to put away as much money to reach your goals!"],"metadata":{"id":"agtBO3wxRbxA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_pq2KTgNReA_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q3.

A histogram is a graph showing frequency distributions. It is a graph showing the number of observations within each given interval.\n","- A histogram shows the frequency on the vertical axis and the horizontal axis is another dimension. Usually it has bins, where every bin has a minimum and maximum value. Each bin also has a frequency between x and infinite. Many things can be added to a histogram such as a fit line, labels and so on.\n","- Matplotlib is used along with NumPy data to plot any type of graph."],"metadata":{"id":"TSCfpb8nRtj1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"kcojPgEeRvqX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q4.

Set the ratio as a three-element vector of positive values that represent the relative axis lengths. For example, plot an elongated circle. Then set the plot box aspect ratio so that the x-axis is twice the length of the y-axis and z-axis (not shown)."],"metadata":{"id":"v_QslqNTR3NP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"E7lGQMNmR7wr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q5.

It has the same function as any other array, but it stores the characters in it and has fixed numbers of elements or indexes. Like any other language, NumPy also supports the character string arrays to store the characters or groups of characters in the form of arrays.\n","- On a regular 32bit system, this is (4294967295 / 2) / 4 or 536870912. Therefore the maximum size of a python list on a 32 bit system is 536,870,912 elements. As long as the number of elements you have is equal or below this, all list functions should operate correctly."],"metadata":{"id":"j3iaKY7RSSoj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"FOTxlDTiSUc_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
