NumPy consumes less memory as compared to Pandas. Indexing of the Series objects is quite slow as compared to NumPy arrays.\n","- Single Column\n","\n","  Step 1: Using Numpy to create an array. # Create an array using Numpy import numpy as np x = np. repeat(['City1','City2'],5) print(x) ...\n","\n","  Step 2: Use pd.DataFrame() to convert the array to a column. # Use pd.DataFrame() to convert the array to a column import pandas as pd df_x=pd."],"metadata":{"id":"6aeBWOl1XHMo"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mY5ktWRBXD4B"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q2.
