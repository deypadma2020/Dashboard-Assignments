Its purpose is to define how other classes should look like, i.e. what methods and properties they are expected to have.\n","\n","---\n","\n","An abstract superclass is one way to provide re-usable code. You can extend the abstract class and inherit the code. This is sometimes more convenient than using static methods or object composition to share code. The abstract class can \"fix\" parts of the code (by making it final)."],"metadata":{"id":"oPMcdknw2wXb"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"oVG66Fw92qwR"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.
